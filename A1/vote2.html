              When registering to vote via the DMV make sure you receive the correct form. One form allows you to register for the first time, the other form is used if you've moved within St. Lawrence County and wish to notify the Board of Elections of your new address to maintain active voting status. Also note it can take up to a month for registrations from the DMV and other social service agencies to reach the board. Therefore your registration will be postmarked timely as of the date received by the St. Lawrence County Board of Elections.
