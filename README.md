Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - I can't find how to email the BoE.
    - I have to do some math to find the early voting dates in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The home page isn't called index.html, which is the traditional name.
    - The home page has only an image, which is pretty but information-free.
    - Remember there is a table tag, which you should use when presenting tabular data.
    - Pages with internal navigation could begin with the first link active to avoid otherwise empty pages.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - Styling needs some work.
    - Blue links are hard to read against the background color.
    - Large blocks of text also get harder to read when they're centered.
    - There is a lot of "dead space" on either side of the content that seems wasteful.
    - The navbar would ideally have a different background to set it off from the content.
    - The navbar doesn't have active-link highlighting, so visitors can't keep track of where they are.
    - The "How to Vote" page contains several lists with inconsistent formatting.
